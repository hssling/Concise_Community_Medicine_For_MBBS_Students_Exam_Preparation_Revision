# Chapter 36: Biostatistics

## Section A: Descriptive Statistics

### Measures of Central Tendency

**Mean (Average):**

*Properties:*
- Most sensitive measure
- Affected by extreme values
- Used for normally distributed data

*Formula:* μ = Σx/n

*Example:* If systolic BP readings are: 120, 130, 140, 150, 160
Mean = (120+130+140+150+160)/5 = 140 mmHg

**Median:**

*Properties:*
- Middle value when ordered
- Less affected by outliers
- Best for skewed distributions

*Example:* For data: 2, 4, 6, 8, 100
Median = 6 (not affected by outlier 100)

**Mode:**

*Properties:*
- Most frequent value
- May have multiple modes
- Used for categorical data

### Measures of Dispersion

**Range:**

*Formula:* Range = Maximum - Minimum

*Example:* Data: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
Range = 30 - 10 = 20

**Variance (σ²):**

*Formula:* σ² = Σ(x-μ)²/n

*Properties:*
- Average squared deviation
- In squared units
- Hard to interpret

**Standard Deviation (σ):**

*Formula:* σ = √σ²

*Properties:*
- Square root of variance
- Same units as original data
- Most commonly used

*Interpretation:*
- About 68% data within 1 SD of mean
- About 95% data within 2 SD of mean
- About 99.7% data within 3 SD of mean

### Percentiles and Quartiles

**Percentiles:**
- Value below which certain percentage falls
- 50th percentile = median
- P90 = 90% values below this point

**Quartiles:**
- Q1 = 25th percentile (first quartile)
- Q2 = 50th percentile (median)
- Q3 = 75th percentile (third quartile)

**Interquartile Range (IQR):**
- IQR = Q3 - Q1
- Measures spread of middle 50% data
- Less affected by outliers

### Data Visualization

**Bar Chart:**
- Categorical data
- Discrete categories

**Histogram:**

## Section B: Inferential Statistics

### Probability Concepts

**Basic Probability:**
- P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total outcomes
- Range: 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%)
- P(A) + P(A') = 1 (A' = not A)

**Addition Rule:**
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

**Multiplication Rule:**
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)

### Hypothesis Testing

**Steps in Hypothesis Testing:**

1. **State hypotheses:**
   - H₀ (null): No effect/association
   - H₁ (alternative): Effect/association exists

2. **Set significance level (α):**
   - Usually 0.05 (5%)

3. **Choose test statistic:**
   - t-test, chi-square, z-test, etc.

4. **Calculate test statistic**

5. **Find p-value**

6. **Make decision:**
   - If p ≤ α, reject H₀
   - If p > α, fail to reject H₀

**Type I Error (α):**
- Reject H₀ when it's true
- False positive
- Probability = significance level

**Type II Error (β):**
- Fail to reject H₀ when it's false
- False negative
- Power = 1 - β

### Confidence Intervals

**Formula for Mean (Large Sample):**
CI = x̄ ± Z(α/2) × (s/√n)

Where:
- x̄ = sample mean
- Z(α/2) = 1.96 for 95% CI
- s = sample standard deviation
- n = sample size

**Formula for Proportion:**
CI = p ± Z(α/2) × √[p(1-p)/n]

**Interpretation:**
95% CI means 95% of such intervals will contain true population parameter

### P-values and Statistical Significance

**P-value:**
- Probability of obtaining results as extreme as observed, assuming H₀ is true
- Smaller p-value = stronger evidence against H₀

**Significance Levels:**
- p < 0.05: Significant (*)
- p < 0.01: Highly significant (**)
- p < 0.001: Very highly significant (***)

### Statistical Tests Selection

**Parametric Tests:**
- Assume normal distribution
- More powerful
- Require interval/ratio data
- Examples: t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation

**Non-parametric Tests:**
- No distribution assumptions
- Less powerful
- Use ordinal data
- Examples: Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman correlation

**Test Selection Guide:**

| Data Type | Groups | Parametric | Non-parametric |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Continuous | 2 | t-test | Mann-Whitney U |
| Continuous | 3+ | ANOVA | Kruskal-Wallis |

- Range: -1 to +1
- r = 1: Perfect positive correlation
- r = 0: No linear correlation
- r = -1: Perfect negative correlation

**Formula:**
r = Σ[(x-x̄)(y-ȳ)] / √[Σ(x-x̄)² × Σ(y-ȳ)²]

**Spearman Rank Correlation:**

- Uses ranks instead of actual values
- Good for ordinal data or non-linear relationships

- b = slope = r × (s_y/s_x)

*Multiple Linear Regression:*
Y = a + b₁X₁ + b₂X₂ + ... + bₙXₙ

| Source | SS | df | MS | F | p-value |
|--------|----|----|----|----|---------|
| Between | SSB | k-1 | MSB = SSB/(k-1) | MSB/MSW | |

**Odds Ratio Interpretation:**
- OR = 1: No association
- OR > 1: Increased odds
- OR < 1: Decreased odds

**Example:** If OR for smoking and lung cancer = 10
Interpretation: Smokers have 10 times higher odds of lung cancer

# Practical Examples and Calculations

## Research Methodology Examples

**Sample Size Calculation Example:**
*Problem*: Calculate sample size to detect 5 mmHg difference in systolic BP between two groups, assuming SD = 15 mmHg, α = 0.05, power = 80%

*Solution*:
n = 2(1.96 + 0.84)² × 15² / 5²
n = 2(7.84) × 225 / 25
n = 2 × 7.84 × 9
n = 141.12 ≈ 142 per group

## Biostatistics Examples

**Descriptive Statistics Example:**
*Data*: Age of 10 patients: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70

*Mean* = (25+30+35+40+45+50+55+60+65+70)/10 = 475/10 = 47.5 years

*Median* = (45+50)/2 = 47.5 years

*Range* = 70-25 = 45 years

**Confidence Interval Example:**
*Data*: Sample mean = 120 mmHg, SD = 15 mmHg, n = 100

95% CI = 120 ± 1.96 × (15/√100)
95% CI = 120 ± 1.96 × 1.5
95% CI = 120 ± 2.94
95% CI = (117.06, 122.94) mmHg

**Chi-square Test Example:**
*Problem*: Association between smoking and lung cancer

|          | Cancer | No Cancer | Total |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Smokers  | 80     | 120       | 200   |
| Non-smokers | 20     | 180       | 200   |
| Total    | 100    | 300       | 400   |

*Expected frequencies*:
- Smokers with cancer: (200×100)/400 = 50
- Smokers without cancer: (200×300)/400 = 150
- Non-smokers with cancer: (200×100)/400 = 50
- Non-smokers without cancer: (200×300)/400 = 150

*Chi-square calculation*:
χ² = (80-50)²/50 + (120-150)²/150 + (20-50)²/50 + (180-150)²/150
χ² = 900/50 + 900/150 + 900/50 + 900/150
χ² = 18 + 6 + 18 + 6 = 48

df = (2-1) × (2-1) = 1
p < 0.001 (highly significant)

## Demography Examples

**Population Growth Calculation:**
*Problem*: Population in 2020 = 1 billion, CBR = 20/1000, CDR = 8/1000, net migration = 100,000

*Annual increase* = (20-8)/1000 × 1,000,000,000 + 100,000
= 12/1000 × 1,000,000,000 + 100,000
= 12,000,000 + 100,000 = 12,100,000

*Growth rate* = 12,100,000 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.0121 = 1.21%

**Sex Ratio Calculation:**
*Problem*: Males = 51,000, Females = 49,000

Sex ratio = (51,000/49,000) × 1000 = 1041 males per 1000 females

**Dependency Ratio Calculation:**
*Problem*: Age 0-14 = 25,000, Age 15-64 = 60,000, Age 65+ = 5,000

Dependency ratio = ((25,000 + 5,000)/60,000) × 100
= (30,000/60,000) × 100 = 50%
