## Chapter 14: Epidemiology

### Section A: Basic Concepts

#### Definition and Scope of Epidemiology
**Definition**: Study of distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and application to control health problems.

**CORE SCOPE**:
- **What**: Distribution of disease/health states
- **Why**: Determinants/causes of disease
- **Who**: Populations and subgroups
- **Where**: Geographic distribution
- **When**: Temporal patterns
- **How**: Application to control and prevention

**EXAMINATION FOCUS**:
```
Key Words to Remember: "DISEASE + DETERMINANTS + POPULATION + CONTROL"
```

#### Epidemiological Approach
**Systematic Scientific Method**:

1. **Observation** - Identify health problem
2. **Hypothesis Formation** - Propose explanations
3. **Testing** - Conduct studies
4. **Analysis** - Interpret results
5. **Application** - Implement control measures

**EXAM TIP**: Always mention all 5 steps when explaining epidemiological approach!

#### Epidemiological Triad
**Classical Model of Disease Causation**:

```
┌─────────────┐      Agent      ┌─────────────┐
│   HOST      │ ←──────────────→ │ ENVIRONMENT │
└─────────────┘                  └─────────────┘
        ↓                              ↓
    Susceptibility                 Environmental
    Immunity                       Factors
    Age, Sex,                      Temperature,
    Genetics                       Humidity,
                                  Sanitation,
                                  Socio-economic
                                  factors
```

**HOST FACTORS** (Intrinsic):
- Age, sex, race, genetics
- Physiological state
- Immunological status
- Previous exposure

**AGENT FACTORS**:
- Biological (bacteria, virus, parasite)
- Chemical (toxins, pollutants)
- Physical (radiation, trauma)
- Nutritional (deficiencies)

**ENVIRONMENT FACTORS** (Extrinsic):
- Physical (climate, geography)
- Biological (vectors, reservoirs)
- Social (crowding, sanitation)

#### Natural History of Disease
**Stages of Disease Progression**:

```
Susceptible ←→ Pre-pathogenic
     ↓
Exposure ←→ Pathogenic Changes
     ↓
Early Disease ←→ Subclinical
     ↓
Clinical Disease ←→ Manifest symptoms
     ↓
Recovery ←→ Disability ←→ Death
```

**Key Points**:
- **Pre-pathogenic**: Before disease process begins
- **Pathogenic**: Disease process initiated
- **Subclinical**: Changes occur but no symptoms
- **Clinical**: Signs and symptoms appear

#### Iceberg Phenomenon
**Concept**: For every clinically apparent case, many subclinical cases exist in the population.

```
      Clinical Cases (Visible - tip of iceberg)
     ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
     │      Cases with symptoms            │
     │                                     │
     │          Cases with disease         │
     │            (Total cases)            │
     │                                     │
     │        All infected persons         │
     │           (Iceberg below)           │
     └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**EXAM SIGNIFICANCE**:
- Underestimation of true disease burden
- Importance of screening programs
- Community diagnosis vs. individual diagnosis

#### Population vs Clinical Medicine
| Aspect | Population Medicine | Clinical Medicine |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Unit of Study** | Population/Community | Individual Patient |
| **Goal** | Prevention & Health Promotion | Treatment & Cure |
| **Methods** | Epidemiological approach | Clinical examination |
| **Outcomes** | Health indicators | Patient outcomes |
| **Intervention** | Primary/Secondary prevention | Tertiary prevention |

#### Disease Causation - Web of Causation
**Modern Understanding**: Disease results from complex web of multiple factors, not single cause.

**Example - Tuberculosis**:
```
← Socio-economic factors
   ↓
← Malnutrition ← Crowding
   ↓              ↓
← Previous TB ← HIV infection ← Social stigma
   ↓              ↓              ↓
← Delayed diagnosis ← Drug resistance
```

**NO SINGLE CAUSE** - Multiple interconnected factors create "web"

#### Risk Factors and Risk Assessment
**Risk Factor**: An attribute or exposure associated with increased probability of disease.

**Types of Risk Factors**:
- **Modifiable**: Smoking, diet, exercise
- **Non-modifiable**: Age, sex, genetics

**Risk Assessment Process**:
1. Identify risk factor
2. Measure association strength
3. Assess temporal relationship
4. Consider dose-response
5. Evaluate biological plausibility

8. **Experiment**: Intervention supports causation
9. **Analogy**: Similar to known causes

**EXAM TIP**: Remember "SPECIFICITY-BIOCOHERENCE" acronym!

### Section C: Measurements in Epidemiology

#### Incidence vs Prevalence
**Incidence**: New cases in specified time period
- **Cumulative Incidence**: New cases/Population at risk
- **Incidence Rate**: New cases/Person-time

**Prevalence**: All existing cases at specific time
- **Point prevalence**: At single point
- **Period prevalence**: Over time period

**Relationship**: Prevalence = Incidence × Duration

**EXAM FORMULAS**:
```
Cumulative Incidence = New cases/Total population at start
Incidence Rate = New cases/Total person-time
Point Prevalence = Existing cases/Total population
```

#### Attack Rate, Case Fatality Rate
**Attack Rate**: Proportion of susceptible individuals who become ill during epidemic
```
Attack Rate = (New cases/Total susceptible) × 100
```

**Case Fatality Rate**: Proportion of cases that result in death
```
CFR = (Deaths from disease/Total cases) × 100
```

**Secondary Attack Rate**: Attack rate among contacts of primary cases
```
SAR = (New cases among contacts/Exposed contacts) × 100
```

#### Sensitivity, Specificity, Predictive Values
**Screening Test Evaluation**:

```
                Disease Status
              ┌─────────────┐
              │ Positive│Neg.│ Total
┌─────────────┼─────────┼───┼─────┐
│Test Positive│   TP    │ FP│ TP+FP│
├─────────────┼─────────┼───┼─────┤
│Test Negative│   FN    │ TN│ FN+TN│
├─────────────┼─────────┼───┼─────┤
│   Total     │  TP+FN  │...│  N   │
└─────────────┴─────────┴───┴─────┘
```

**Sensitivity**: Ability to correctly identify disease
```
Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN) × 100
```

**Specificity**: Ability to correctly identify non-disease
```
Specificity = TN/(TN+FP) × 100
```

**Positive Predictive Value**: Probability of disease given positive test
```
PPV = TP/(TP+FP) × 100
```

**Negative Predictive Value**: Probability of no disease given negative test
```
NPV = TN/(TN+FN) × 100
```

#### Relative Risk, Odds Ratio, Attributable Risk
**Relative Risk (RR)**: Risk in exposed vs unexposed
```
RR = [a/(a+b)]/[c/(c+d)]
```

**Odds Ratio (OR)**: Odds of exposure in cases vs controls
```
OR = (a×d)/(b×c)
```

**Attributable Risk (AR)**: Excess risk due to exposure
```
AR = Risk exposed - Risk unexposed
```

**Population Attributable Risk (PAR)**:
```
PAR = Pe(RR-1)/[Pe(RR-1)+1]
Where Pe = Prevalence of exposure
```

#### Standardization - Direct and Indirect Methods
**Purpose**: Remove effect of age/other factors when comparing rates

**Direct Standardization**:
1. Apply observed rates to standard population
2. Calculate expected deaths
3. Standardized Death Rate (SDR) = Expected deaths/Standard population

**Indirect Standardization**:
1. Use standard mortality rates
2. Calculate expected deaths in study population
3. Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) = Observed/Expected deaths

**EXAM POINTS**:
- Direct method: Requires age-specific rates
- Indirect method: Requires only total deaths and standard rates
- SMR interpretation: >100 means higher mortality than standard

## Epidemiological Calculations with Step-by-Step Examples

### Example 1: Basic Rates Calculation
**Problem**: In a population of 50,000, there were 100 new cases of disease X and 20 deaths from disease X in 2024. Calculate incidence rate, cumulative incidence, prevalence (if 150 cases existed throughout the year), and case fatality rate.

**Solution**:
```
Population = 50,000
New cases = 100
Deaths = 20
Existing cases = 150

Cumulative Incidence = 100/50,000 = 0.002 or 0.2%
Incidence Rate = 100/(50,000 person-years) = 2 per 1,000 person-years
Point Prevalence = 150/50,000 = 0.003 or 0.3%
Case Fatality Rate = 20/100 × 100 = 20%
```

### Example 2: Sensitivity and Specificity Calculation
**Problem**: A new test for disease Y was evaluated in 1,000 individuals. The gold standard showed 200 people had the disease, 800 did not. The new test was positive in 180 people with disease and 50 people without disease.

**Solution**:
```
                    Disease Present    Disease Absent    Total
Test Positive        180              50              230
Test Negative         20             750              770
Total                200             800             1000

Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN) = 180/200 × 100 = 90%
Specificity = TN/(TN+FP) = 750/800 × 100 = 93.75%
PPV = TP/(TP+FP) = 180/230 × 100 = 78.26%
NPV = TN/(TN+FN) = 750/770 × 100 = 97.40%
```

### Example 3: Relative Risk and Odds Ratio
**Problem**: In a cohort study of 1,000 smokers and 1,000 non-smokers followed for 10 years, lung cancer developed in 50 smokers and 5 non-smokers.

**Solution**:
```
                    Lung Cancer    No Lung Cancer    Total
Smokers                50              950           1,000
Non-smokers             5              995           1,000

Risk in smokers = 50/1000 = 0.05
Risk in non-smokers = 5/1000 = 0.005
Relative Risk = 0.05/0.005 = 10

Interpretation: Smokers have 10 times higher risk of lung cancer
```

### Example 4: Standardization Calculation
**Problem**: Compare mortality rates between two areas with different age distributions.

```
Age Group    Study Area A    Study Area B    Standard Population
0-24          1,000           800            3,000
25-49         2,000           1,500          4,000
50+           1,000           700            2,000
Total         4,000           3,000          9,000

Deaths in A:  100            80              50
Deaths in B:   60            90              60
```

**Direct Standardization**:
```
Expected deaths A = (1/1000×3000) + (80/2000×4000) + (50/1000×2000)
                  = 3 + 160 + 100 = 263
Expected deaths B = (60/800×3000) + (90/1500×4000) + (60/700×2000)
                  = 225 + 240 + 171.4 = 636.4

SDR A = 263/9000 × 1000 = 29.2 per 1,000
SDR B = 636.4/9000 × 1000 = 70.7 per 1,000
```
