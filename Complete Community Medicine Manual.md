## Chapter 14: Epidemiology

### Section A: Basic Concepts

#### Definition and Scope of Epidemiology

**Definition**: Study of distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and application to control health problems.

**CORE SCOPE**:
- **What**: Distribution of disease/health states
- **Why**: Determinants/causes of disease
- **Who**: Populations and subgroups
- **Where**: Geographic distribution
- **When**: Temporal patterns
- **How**: Application to control and prevention

**EXAMINATION FOCUS**:
```
Key Words to Remember: "DISEASE + DETERMINANTS + POPULATION + CONTROL"
```

#### Epidemiological Approach

**Systematic Scientific Method**:

1. **Observation** - Identify health problem
2. **Hypothesis Formation** - Propose explanations
3. **Testing** - Conduct studies
4. **Analysis** - Interpret results
5. **Application** - Implement control measures

**EXAM TIP**: Always mention all 5 steps when explaining epidemiological approach!

#### Epidemiological Triad

**Classical Model of Disease Causation**:

```
┌─────────────┐      Agent      ┌─────────────┐
│   HOST      │ ←──────────────→ │ ENVIRONMENT │
└─────────────┘                  └─────────────┘
        ↓                              ↓
    Susceptibility                 Environmental
    Immunity                       Factors
    Age, Sex,                      Temperature,
    Genetics                       Humidity,
                                   Sanitation,
                                   Socio-economic
                                   factors
```

**HOST FACTORS** (Intrinsic):
- Age, sex, race, genetics
- Physiological state
- Immunological status
- Previous exposure

**AGENT FACTORS**:
- Biological (bacteria, virus, parasite)
- Chemical (toxins, pollutants)
- Physical (radiation, trauma)
- Nutritional (deficiencies)

**ENVIRONMENT FACTORS** (Extrinsic):
- Physical (climate, geography)
- Biological (vectors, reservoirs)
- Social (crowding, sanitation)

#### Natural History of Disease

**Stages of Disease Progression**:

```
Susceptible ←→ Pre-pathogenic
     ↓
Exposure ←→ Pathogenic Changes
     ↓
Early Disease ←→ Subclinical
     ↓
Clinical Disease ←→ Manifest symptoms
     ↓
Recovery ←→ Disability ←→ Death
```

**Key Points**:
- **Pre-pathogenic**: Before disease process begins
- **Pathogenic**: Disease process initiated
- **Subclinical**: Changes occur but no symptoms
- **Clinical**: Signs and symptoms appear

#### Iceberg Phenomenon

**Concept**: For every clinically apparent case, many subclinical cases exist in the population.

```
      Clinical Cases (Visible - tip of iceberg)
     ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
     │      Cases with symptoms            │
     │                                     │
     │          Cases with disease         │
     │            (Total cases)            │
     │                                     │
     │        All infected persons         │
     │           (Iceberg below)           │
     └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**EXAM SIGNIFICANCE**:
- Underestimation of true disease burden
- Importance of screening programs
- Community diagnosis vs. individual diagnosis

#### Population vs Clinical Medicine
| Aspect | Population Medicine | Clinical Medicine |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Unit of Study** | Population/Community | Individual Patient |
| **Goal** | Prevention & Health Promotion | Treatment & Cure |
| **Methods** | Epidemiological approach | Clinical examination |
| **Outcomes** | Health indicators | Patient outcomes |
| **Intervention** | Primary/Secondary prevention | Tertiary prevention |

#### Disease Causation - Web of Causation

**Modern Understanding**: Disease results from complex web of multiple factors, not single cause.

**Example - Tuberculosis**:
```
← Socio-economic factors
   ↓
← Malnutrition ← Crowding
   ↓              ↓
← Previous TB ← HIV infection ← Social stigma
   ↓              ↓              ↓
← Delayed diagnosis ← Drug resistance
```

**NO SINGLE CAUSE** - Multiple interconnected factors create "web"

#### Risk Factors and Risk Assessment

**Risk Factor**: An attribute or exposure associated with increased probability of disease.

**Types of Risk Factors**:
- **Modifiable**: Smoking, diet, exercise
- **Non-modifiable**: Age, sex, genetics

**Risk Assessment Process**:
1. Identify risk factor
2. Measure association strength
3. Assess temporal relationship
4. Consider dose-response
5. Evaluate biological plausibility

**Case-Control Studies**:
```
             Disease Status
        ┌──────────────┐
        │  Yes │  No   │
┌───────┼──────┼───────┤
│Exposed│  a   │   b   │  ← Cases with exposure
├───────┼──────┼───────┤
│Unexp. │  c   │   d   │  ← Controls
└───────┼──────┴───────┘
```

**Odds Ratio (OR) = (a×d)/(b×c)**
- OR > 1: Risk factor
- OR < 1: Protective factor
- OR = 1: No association

**Cohort Studies**:
```
       Disease Development
       ┌─────────────────┐
       │   Yes    No    │
┌──────┼─────┬───────┐
│Exp.  │  a  │   b   │  ← Exposed group
├──────┼─────┼───────┤
│Unexp.│  c  │   d   │  ← Unexposed group
└──────┴─────┴───────┘

2. Associated with outcome
3. Not on causal pathway

**Effect Modification** - Effect of exposure varies by level of third variable
- Not a bias
- Important to identify
- Present in subgroup analysis

#### Causation Criteria - Bradford Hill Criteria

**Strength of Evidence for Causation**:

1. **Strength**: Strong association (high RR/OR)
2. **Consistency**: Repeated across studies
3. **Specificity**: One cause → one effect
4. **Temporality**: Cause precedes effect
5. **Biological gradient**: Dose-response relationship
6. **Plausibility**: Biologically reasonable
7. **Coherence**: Fits existing knowledge
8. **Experiment**: Intervention supports causation
9. **Analogy**: Similar to known causes

**EXAM TIP**: Remember "SPECIFICITY-BIOCOHERENCE" acronym!

### Section C: Measurements in Epidemiology

#### Incidence vs Prevalence

**Incidence**: New cases in specified time period
- **Cumulative Incidence**: New cases/Population at risk
- **Incidence Rate**: New cases/Person-time

**Prevalence**: All existing cases at specific time
- **Point prevalence**: At single point
- **Period prevalence**: Over time period

**Relationship**: Prevalence = Incidence × Duration

**EXAM FORMULAS**:
```
Cumulative Incidence = New cases/Total population at start
Incidence Rate = New cases/Total person-time
Point Prevalence = Existing cases/Total population
```

#### Attack Rate, Case Fatality Rate

**Attack Rate**: Proportion of susceptible individuals who become ill during epidemic
```
Attack Rate = (New cases/Total susceptible) × 100
```

**Case Fatality Rate**: Proportion of cases that result in death
```
CFR = (Deaths from disease/Total cases) × 100
```

**Secondary Attack Rate**: Attack rate among contacts of primary cases
```
SAR = (New cases among contacts/Exposed contacts) × 100
```

#### Sensitivity, Specificity, Predictive Values

**Screening Test Evaluation**:

```
                Disease Status
              ┌─────────────┐
              │ Positive│Neg.│ Total
┌─────────────┼─────────┼───┼─────┐
│Test Positive│   TP    │ FP│ TP+FP│
├─────────────┼─────────┼───┼─────┤
│Test Negative│   FN    │ TN│ FN+TN│
├─────────────┼─────────┼───┼─────┤
│   Total     │  TP+FN  │...│  N   │
└─────────────┴─────────┴───┴─────┘
```

**Sensitivity**: Ability to correctly identify disease
```
Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN) × 100
```

**Specificity**: Ability to correctly identify non-disease
```
Specificity = TN/(TN+FP) × 100
```

**Positive Predictive Value**: Probability of disease given positive test
```
PPV = TP/(TP+FP) × 100
```

**Negative Predictive Value**: Probability of no disease given negative test
```
NPV = TN/(TN+FN) × 100
```

#### Relative Risk, Odds Ratio, Attributable Risk

**Relative Risk (RR)**: Risk in exposed vs unexposed
```
RR = [a/(a+b)]/[c/(c+d)]
```

**Odds Ratio (OR)**: Odds of exposure in cases vs controls
```
OR = (a×d)/(b×c)
```

**Attributable Risk (AR)**: Excess risk due to exposure
```
AR = Risk exposed - Risk unexposed
```

**Population Attributable Risk (PAR)**:
```
PAR = Pe(RR-1)/[Pe(RR-1)+1]
Where Pe = Prevalence of exposure
```

#### Standardization - Direct and Indirect Methods

**Purpose**: Remove effect of age/other factors when comparing rates

**Direct Standardization**:
1. Apply observed rates to standard population
2. Calculate expected deaths
3. Standardized Death Rate (SDR) = Expected deaths/Standard population

**Indirect Standardization**:
1. Use standard mortality rates
2. Calculate expected deaths in study population
3. Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) = Observed/Expected deaths

**EXAM POINTS**:
- Direct method: Requires age-specific rates
- Indirect method: Requires only total deaths and standard rates
- SMR interpretation: >100 means higher mortality than standard

- Most sensitive measure
- Affected by extreme values
- Used for normally distributed data

*Formula:* μ = Σx/n

*Example:* If systolic BP readings are: 120, 130, 140, 150, 160
Mean = (120+130+140+150+160)/5 = 140 mmHg

**Median:**

*Properties:*
- Middle value when ordered
- Less affected by outliers
- Best for skewed distributions

*Example:* For data: 2, 4, 6, 8, 100
Median = 6 (not affected by outlier 100)

**Mode:**

*Properties:*
- Most frequent value
- May have multiple modes
- Used for categorical data

### Measures of Dispersion

- P90 = 90% values below this point

**Quartiles:**
- Q1 = 25th percentile (first quartile)
- Q2 = 50th percentile (median)
- Q3 = 75th percentile (third quartile)

**Interquartile Range (IQR):**

## Section B: Inferential Statistics

### Probability Concepts

**Basic Probability:**
- P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total outcomes
- Range: 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%)
- P(A) + P(A') = 1 (A' = not A)

**Addition Rule:**
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

**Multiplication Rule:**
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)

### Hypothesis Testing

**Steps in Hypothesis Testing:**

1. **State hypotheses:**
   - H₀ (null): No effect/association
   - H₁ (alternative): Effect/association exists

2. **Set significance level (α):**
   - Usually 0.05 (5%)

3. **Choose test statistic:**
   - t-test, chi-square, z-test, etc.

4. **Calculate test statistic**

5. **Find p-value**

6. **Make decision:**
   - If p ≤ α, reject H₀
   - If p > α, fail to reject H₀

**Type I Error (α):**
- Reject H₀ when it's true
- False positive
- Probability = significance level

**Type II Error (β):**
- Fail to reject H₀ when it's false
- False negative
- Power = 1 - β

### Confidence Intervals

**Formula for Mean (Large Sample):**
CI = x̄ ± Z(α/2) × (s/√n)

Where:
- x̄ = sample mean
- Z(α/2) = 1.96 for 95% CI
- s = sample standard deviation
- n = sample size

**Formula for Proportion:**
CI = p ± Z(α/2) × √[p(1-p)/n]

**Interpretation:**
95% CI means 95% of such intervals will contain true population parameter

### P-values and Statistical Significance

**P-value:**
- Probability of obtaining results as extreme as observed, assuming H₀ is true
- Smaller p-value = stronger evidence against H₀

**Significance Levels:**
- p < 0.05: Significant (*)
- p < 0.01: Highly significant (**)
- p < 0.001: Very highly significant (***)

### Statistical Tests Selection

**Parametric Tests:**

- r = 0: No linear correlation
- r = -1: Perfect negative correlation

**Formula:**
r = Σ[(x-x̄)(y-ȳ)] / √[Σ(x-x̄)² × Σ(y-ȳ)²]

**Spearman Rank Correlation:**
- Non-parametric alternative
- Uses ranks instead of actual values
- Good for ordinal data or non-linear relationships

- b = slope = r × (s_y/s_x)

*Multiple Linear Regression:*
Y = a + b₁X₁ + b₂X₂ + ... + bₙXₙ

logit(p) = ln[p/(1-p)] = b₀ + b₁X₁ + b₂X₂ + ...

**Odds Ratio Interpretation:**
- OR = 1: No association
- OR > 1: Increased odds
- OR < 1: Decreased odds

# Practical Examples and Calculations

## Research Methodology Examples

**Sample Size Calculation Example:**
*Problem*: Calculate sample size to detect 5 mmHg difference in systolic BP between two groups, assuming SD = 15 mmHg, α = 0.05, power = 80%

*Solution*:
n = 2(1.96 + 0.84)² × 15² / 5²
n = 2(7.84) × 225 / 25
n = 2 × 7.84 × 9
n = 141.12 ≈ 142 per group

## Biostatistics Examples

**Descriptive Statistics Example:**
*Data*: Age of 10 patients: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70

*Mean* = (25+30+35+40+45+50+55+60+65+70)/10 = 475/10 = 47.5 years

*Median* = (45+50)/2 = 47.5 years

*Range* = 70-25 = 45 years

**Confidence Interval Example:**
*Data*: Sample mean = 120 mmHg, SD = 15 mmHg, n = 100

95% CI = 120 ± 1.96 × (15/√100)
95% CI = 120 ± 1.96 × 1.5
95% CI = 120 ± 2.94
95% CI = (117.06, 122.94) mmHg

**Chi-square Test Example:**
*Problem*: Association between smoking and lung cancer

|          | Cancer | No Cancer | Total |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Smokers  | 80     | 120       | 200   |
| Non-smokers | 20     | 180       | 200   |
| Total    | 100    | 300       | 400   |

*Expected frequencies*:
- Smokers with cancer: (200×100)/400 = 50
- Smokers without cancer: (200×300)/400 = 150
- Non-smokers with cancer: (200×100)/400 = 50
- Non-smokers without cancer: (200×300)/400 = 150

*Chi-square calculation*:
χ² = (80-50)²/50 + (120-150)²/150 + (20-50)²/50 + (180-150)²/150
χ² = 900/50 + 900/150 + 900/50 + 900/150
χ² = 18 + 6 + 18 + 6 = 48

df = (2-1) × (2-1) = 1
p < 0.001 (highly significant)

## Demography Examples

**Population Growth Calculation:**
*Problem*: Population in 2020 = 1 billion, CBR = 20/1000, CDR = 8/1000, net migration = 100,000

*Annual increase* = (20-8)/1000 × 1,000,000,000 + 100,000
= 12/1000 × 1,000,000,000 + 100,000
= 12,000,000 + 100,000 = 12,100,000

*Growth rate* = 12,100,000 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.0121 = 1.21%

**Sex Ratio Calculation:**
*Problem*: Males = 51,000, Females = 49,000

Sex ratio = (51,000/49,000) × 1000 = 1041 males per 1000 females

**Dependency Ratio Calculation:**
*Problem*: Age 0-14 = 25,000, Age 15-64 = 60,000, Age 65+ = 5,000

Dependency ratio = ((25,000 + 5,000)/60,000) × 100
= (30,000/60,000) × 100 = 50%
